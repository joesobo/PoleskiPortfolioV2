### Custom Query

Utilize the `DOM Testing Library` help functions to create your own custom queries for tests. 

> Ex: Instead of `getAllById`, you could make a `getAllByAriaLabel`

#### Build Queries

The `buildQueries` helper helps create custom queries with all of the standard functions that come with the default queries.
