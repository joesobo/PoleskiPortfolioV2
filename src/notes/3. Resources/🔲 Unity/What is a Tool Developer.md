# What is a Tool Developer?

Doesnt work on the code in the game but the code for the developers working on the game. Designing tools to cleanup, verify, and speed up the game development process. Can be used to add a feature to unity that doesnt exist or is difficult to implement.

Important for tool developers to have an understanding of who uses your tool and what they will be using it for. Engineer vs artist? What is the context and how would you use it if you were going to. How does someone whos never seen this tool use it and how would they expand upon it.

Goal is the new team members or level designers should be able to start working without having to remember all of the overhead. What work are you adding and what are you alieving with your tool?
