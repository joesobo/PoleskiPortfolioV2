## The Method

This system of organizing notes is strongly influenced by the [[PARA]] method. It has been heavily modified to fit my needs and desires, including but not limited to:

- Custom plugins
- Custom theming
- Custom scripting for tables and auto filling
- An input box for faster note taking

These group of notes are ever changing, and are likely to undergo another large refactor before im truly (if ever) done.

### Getting Started

The first element of note is the [[🌱 Seed Box]], where all notes begin. Feel free to start with notes in this section so that you don't have to immedietly worry about organization and linking.

### [[1. Projects]]

In this section you store all the projects that you are currently working on. This includes projects for work or personal. Projects should be something completable with a due date.

All projects should be contained within their own folder. `Ctrl + Click` to make the folder into its own document using the plugin [[Folder Note]]. We have a custom [[Project Template|template]] made to make this process easier.

```ad-tip
- Remember to include links to all the related project files within the folder
- Remember to include a link to the folder project in [[1. Projects]]
```

### [[2. Areas]]

This section contains all of the areas of your life that you feel are important to you. It is an _area_ that you would like to uphold and maintain.

The difference between areas and projects is that the areas have no definitive due date. The areas are also more vague and often the hierarchical parent to projects.

It is recommended to use this [[Folder Template|template]] when starting a new area.

### [[3. Resources]]

This section is similar to areas in that it contains broad categories of lots of documents. The difference though is that while areas are things that relate directly to you, the resources should be a place for information that you would be comfortable sharing with others.

Consider this as a public repository that other people could look in at any time. If you would feel fine with someone seeing the contents of the document, then consider adding it to an appropriate area.

Don't blindly add stuff to this category, however. This folder should still contain topics that you are interested in, but maybe don't have an obligation to uphold.

### [[4. Archive]]

This is the final section. When any content from the other 3 [[1. Projects|P]][[2. Areas|A]][[3. Resources|R]]A becomes stale, outdated, or even just complete, move it into this section.

The archive is a place to store everything that you ever have worked on in the past. It is a _messy_ walk through the past.

Don't feel too obligated to clean this section up, but also don't treat it like a trash can. Documents in this section are still important for later reference. Besides you would be surprised what gets connected with the graph.
