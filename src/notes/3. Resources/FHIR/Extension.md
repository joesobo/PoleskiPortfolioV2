## What is an Extension?
- User defined addition to a [[Element]] or [[Resource]]
- [[Extension]]s function the same as [[Element]]s
- [[Extension]]s can contain other extensions
- the *url* is a property that defines what the extension is
- a primitive type can have an extension (the name will be prefixed with a `_`)
