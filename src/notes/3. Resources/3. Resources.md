This is a central location for storing all of my public notes. These are the notes that I think could be important / useful for others but don't contain any of my personal information. These notes are always in a state of change being that I am constantly learning things. The goal is to create a constantly growing repository of knowledge so that I have to rely less on my crappy brain. 

While these notes are not perfect, hopefully others can gain some knowledge or at least a starting place. If you want feel free to send me suggestions if you notice anything missing / wrong.
